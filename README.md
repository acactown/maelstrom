# Maelstrom
Maelstrom is a reusable pipeline that achieves operational improvements as well as increasing confidence, security, quality and speed of software we build by providing a deterministic, standardised and flexible Continuous Integration/Delivery process. Kubernetes is the primary focus of Maelstrom, however, Maelstrom is extensible and works with any tech stack.

Many groups have their own pipeline requirements. Developers want control and flexibility over their builds while QA/Security want all assets to go through a predefined set of workflows. Ops want to deploys happen the same way, every time, in a reproducible manner across all envs.

That translates to:
Standardizing the way we build, release and deploy assets across products
Simplified and predictable release and deployment process
Providing Developers with the ability to easily change the pipeline to fit their workflow
Increased confidence in the quality process (Central Automation and Performance)
Security metrics and rule enforcement (image and CVE scans, etc)
Tracking of events that happen in production related to provisioning and deployment
Better exposure of metrics related to the pipeline

Maelstrom helps with all of that (and more) by providing predictable Phases and Stages and ultimately helps teams adhere to our SDLC through automation and data gathering.
